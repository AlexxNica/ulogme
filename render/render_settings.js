This function takes a raw window title w as string
and outputs a more compact code, to be treated as a single
unit during rendering. Every single possibility output from
this function will have its own row and its own analysis,
so it is recommended that only few possible outputs exist,
and use of MISC category as shown in example is encouraged.
